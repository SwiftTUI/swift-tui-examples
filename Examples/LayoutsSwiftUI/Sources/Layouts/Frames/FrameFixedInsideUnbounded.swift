/// same whether it sits inside a "tight" HStack (where a sibling and a
/// trailing `Spacer()` pull and push at its edges) or inside an
/// "unbounded" VStack that only gives it a trailing `Spacer()`.
///
/// Pinning the same visible box in both contexts shows that the
/// fixed-size frame does not change its dimensions based on the
/// surrounding stack's layout behaviour. Only the position of the
/// box within its row/column is dictated by the siblings.
///
/// The header `"Frame fixed inside unbounded"` is the catalog marker
/// and appears exactly once at the top of the layout.
