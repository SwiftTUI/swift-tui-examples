/// cells (rather than the full 320×160 backing buffer) keeps both the
/// equality compare and per-frame allocation cheap.

/// **Coordinate mapping** (drawing space → terminal cells), keyed off
/// the Canvas's ``CanvasGrid``:
///
///   - braille (`.braille2x4`): one game cell at `(x, y)` lights one
///     2×4 sub-pixel; the rasterizer packs it into a U+2800–U+28FF
///     braille glyph per terminal cell.
///   - halfCell (`.verticalHalfBlock`): one game cell at `(x, y)`
///     lights one of the two vertical sub-pixels; the rasterizer emits
///     ▀ / ▄ / █.
///   - squareCell (`.fullCell`): the canvas frame is doubled
///     horizontally so each game cell becomes two adjacent terminal
///     cells, preserving the square 2:1 visual aspect from the previous
///     `██` text renderer.
///
/// Each call leaves `context.foreground` untouched so a parent
/// `.foregroundStyle(...)` continues to color the alive cells.
