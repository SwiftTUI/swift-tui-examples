#
# Capture a screenshot of the gallery demo running in kitty.app, with the
# gallery starting on a chosen tab via the gallery's --tab option.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/screenshot_gallery.sh <output.png> [tab-key]
#
# Environment:
#   SCREENSHOT_TAB     Same as positional [tab-key]; defaults to "counter".
#                      Recognised: counter, todo, calculator,
#                      borders-and-shapes, images, animations, file-drop,
#                      physics. Run `gallery-demo --help` for the full list.
#   SCREENSHOT_DELAY   Seconds to wait after kitty launches before
#                      capturing. Default: 2.
#
# Requirements: kitty (Homebrew), macOS screencapture, osascript. The
# script needs Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions for the
# terminal session driving it.
#
# Exit codes: 0 on success; non-zero if kitty failed to launch or the
# gallery binary is missing. The kitty window is always torn down before
# the script returns.
