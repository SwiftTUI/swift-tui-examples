/// Full-screen detail host for one ``LayoutEntry``. Renders
/// `entry.makeView()` filling the available space, with a 1-row
/// footer and a ⌃B key command that calls `onBack` to return to the
/// picker.
///
/// The host deliberately owns no sheet / alert / other presentation
/// seam; individual layouts that demo presentations own their own
/// dismiss handling. See `project_presentation_escape_dismiss.md`.
///
/// Why ⌃B instead of Esc: the framework reserves Esc (and other
/// unmodified navigation keys) for presentation dismissal in
/// `KeyCommandModifier`; consumer-bound single-key commands are
/// silently dropped. ⌃B is the nearest idiomatic "back" chord in
/// terminal UIs.
