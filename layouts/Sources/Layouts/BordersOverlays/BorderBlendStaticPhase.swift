///
///   - LEFT:  phase = 0.0 — the blend starts at its first color
///     (`.red`) at the top-left corner and walks clockwise around the
///     perimeter from there.
///   - RIGHT: phase = 0.5 — the blend is rotated by half a perimeter,
///     so the top-left corner now samples the blend at `t = 0.5`
///     (approximately the midpoint between `.green` and `.cyan`).
///
/// No animation is driven; the contrast is static. The header
/// `"Border blend static phase"` is the catalog marker.
