/// Layout shape: a header marker `Text` over a `ScrollView` of 10 rows
/// constrained to `.frame(height: 8)` and bordered with `.separator`.
/// The whole stack is `.padding(1)`'d and carries a
/// `.sheet(isPresented:)` modifier bound to a `@State Bool`.
///
/// The smoke test (parameterised over `LayoutCatalog.all`) asserts only
/// that the marker `"Sheet over scroll layout"` appears in the raster
/// — the sheet is not toggled in the smoke pass, so what we are pinning
/// is "the modifier wires up cleanly and the underlying content still
/// resolves and paints."
