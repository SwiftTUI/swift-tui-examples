/// (`Text("HELLO")`, 5 cells wide) sits exactly on the boundary of one
/// proposal (`.frame(width: 5)`) and just past it in the other
/// (`.frame(width: 4)`).
///
/// This layout pins the boundary semantics of the library's
/// `ViewThatFits` selector: at proposal width N, does a candidate of
/// intrinsic width N count as "fits" (inclusive) or "does not fit"
/// (exclusive)?
///
/// The library's `LayoutEngine.fits(_:within:)` uses `value <= limit`,
/// so the inclusive case applies: at width 5 the 5-cell `HELLO`
/// candidate fits and is chosen. At width 4 it no longer fits and the
/// fallback `Text("HI")` (2 cells) is chosen.
///
/// Layout shape:
///
/// ```
/// HStack(spacing: 4) {
///   VStack { Text("at width 5:"); ViewThatFits { "HELLO"; "HI" }.frame(width: 5).border(.separator) }
///   VStack { Text("at width 4:"); ViewThatFits { "HELLO"; "HI" }.frame(width: 4).border(.separator) }
/// }
/// ```

/// The header `"View that fits boundary inclusive"` is the catalog
/// marker.
