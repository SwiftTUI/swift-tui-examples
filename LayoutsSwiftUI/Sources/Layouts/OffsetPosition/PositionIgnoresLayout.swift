/// sibling layout that would otherwise place it.

/// A ZStack provides a visible background (a muted-filled `Rectangle`)
/// so the absolute position contrast is obvious; the `[PIN]` label is
/// anchored at `(x: 60, y: 5)` — an OFF-CENTER point chosen so that
/// removing `.position` produces a visibly different raster (the
/// natural ZStack layout would center `[PIN]` near column 40, row 14).
///
/// The header `"Position ignores layout"` is the catalog marker; it
/// lives above the positioned area so the raster row containing `[PIN]`
/// is solely the positioned text.
