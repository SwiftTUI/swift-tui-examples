/// itself 4 cells to the right of the stack's default leading edge.
///
/// The remaining rows hug the stack's leading edge as normal,
/// producing a visible "notch" at the `shifted` row. Row markers
/// (`"plain above"`, `"shifted"`, `"plain below"`) are unique words so
/// that behaviour tests can match any single row unambiguously via
/// substring matching.
///
/// The catalog marker `"VStack leading guide shift"` is the first row
/// so it also hugs the leading edge and acts as a baseline reference.
